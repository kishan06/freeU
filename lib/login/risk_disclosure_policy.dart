Hence, the risks in the disclosure are just estimates, and can differ from what actually occurs.In the light of the risks involved, investors should undertake transactions only if they understand the nature of the relationship into which they are entering, and the extent of their exposure to risk. No consideration should be made without thoroughly understanding and reviewing the risks involved. If you are unsure, you must seek professional advice on the same.'

It is recommended that investors carefully review all available information regarding an investment before making a decision to invest. This includes reviewing the offering documents, the investment manager's track record, and any associated risks. Investors are advised to carefully review the disclosure papers, agreements, investment documents, and other related credentials carefully and consult their legal, tax and financial advisors, if they want, to determine any possible legal, tax and financial or any other consequences of investing before making any final investment decisions."
