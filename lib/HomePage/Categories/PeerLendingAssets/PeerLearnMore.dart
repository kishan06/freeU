          """Peer-to-Peer lending, or P2P lending, is a new, innovative platform for alternate financing that allows individuals to directly acquire loans from other individuals, without going through banks, or other financial institutions. This financial innovation allows the P2P investors to get a good return on their invested amounts, much higher than they usually would get from bank savings or Fixed Deposits. Basically, the idea is a traditional banking concept but just done with 100% transparency, unlike banks, and usually with much better returns.  It is a modern business of money lending transactions taking place online i.e. digitally.
P2P lending is also termed "social lending" or "crowd lending", and has been increasingly gaining popularity since it began in 2005.

      "ans":
          """The concept is straightforward. The P2P platforms or online platforms connect the potential borrowers directly with the investors or the lenders. Therefore, there are three parties involved. The Investing platform, the borrower, and the lender. 
The P2P lenders deposit the amount of money they want to invest through an online platform, to be distributed as loans. 
The investors get a choice to evaluate and choose which loans they wish to fund. These are generally used in personal loans or small business loans. The borrower and the lender directly connect and they set the prevailing terms and conditions like interest rates, tenure, repayment terms, fines, penalties, etc. 
Also, certain restrictions are placed by lenders like who can be potential investors. Marketplace lenders charge fees to borrowers and earn a percentage of interest on the loan.
The loan applicant or the borrower has to fill up a detailed financial profile on the peer-to-peer lending platform. The specialized platform then assesses the application based on the risk category and assigns a credit score to the potential applicant. 
Based on that, the interest rates the applicant will pay are decided, and he is provided with loan offers from potential lenders. 
The applicant then evaluates his options and chooses one. If you have a good credit score, interest rates are often lower than bank rates. 
Once the loan is approved, and the applicant gets the money, he/she is responsible for repaying the money with interest. 
The investing platform charges a fee from both the borrower and the lender.

But the P2P does not guarantee the recovery of lenders' money. Therefore, a very important aspect of any P2P lending is the online platform's risk scoring model, the assessment of a prospective borrower.
If the P2P platform does not have a sacrosanct risk-scoring model, and cannot measure the risk levels of the borrower, the lender's investments can end up being high-risk."""

It made it mandatory for all the existing companies of P2P (Peer to Peer) to apply for Peer-to-Peer Lending License in case they want to continue working as a P2P platform.
RBI has set guidelines around how P2P lending platforms need to work. For example, any company that wants to offer P2P lending services needs to register for an NBFC-P2P license from the RBI.
RBI also ensures policies to reduce the risks in these platforms. As per RBI regulations, if a P2P platform shuts down, there is a pre-decided fallback business continuity plan that comes into effect in case of such events... The plan has all the details to keep the information of all lenders and borrowers safe, including all the nitty-gritty about servicing loans for the entire tenure in case of the closure of the platform. RBI has placed these regulatory measures in place to reduce the risks in P2P lending. 
According to the guidelines of the RBI, a lender cannot invest more than Rs. 10 lakhs across every Peer-to-Peer platform. Also, the RBI set a lending limit of up to Rs. 50,000/- which applies to the Borrower as well. RBI regulations for the functioning of the Peer-to-Peer Lending platform increase the credibility of such companies and have a role to play in the growing popularity of P2P in India."""
