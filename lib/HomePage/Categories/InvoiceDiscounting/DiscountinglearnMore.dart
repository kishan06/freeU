          """The concept is straightforward. The P2P platforms or online platforms connect the potential borrowers directly with the investors or the lenders. Therefore, there are three parties involved. The Investing platform, the borrower, and the lender. 
The P2P lenders deposit the amount of money they want to invest through an online platform, to be distributed as loans. 
The investors get a choice to evaluate and choose which loans they wish to fund. These are generally used in personal loans or small business loans. The borrower and the lender directly connect and they set the prevailing terms and conditions like interest rates, tenure, repayment terms, fines, penalties, etc. 
Also, certain restrictions are placed by lenders like who can be potential investors. Marketplace lenders charge fees to borrowers and earn a percentage of interest on the loan.
The loan applicant or the borrower has to fill up a detailed financial profile on the peer-to-peer lending platform. The specialized platform then assesses the application based on the risk category and assigns a credit score to the potential applicant. 
Based on that, the interest rates the applicant will pay are decided, and he is provided with loan offers from potential lenders. 
The applicant then evaluates his options and chooses one. If you have a good credit score, interest rates are often lower than bank rates. 
Once the loan is approved, and the applicant gets the money, he/she is responsible for repaying the money with interest. 
The investing platform charges a fee from both the borrower and the lender.

          """The P2P platform can support the lenders in the retrieval of the money, and also help file legal notice against the defaulter if necessary. But the P2P does not guarantee the recovery of lenders' money. Therefore, a very important aspect of any P2P lending is the online platform's risk scoring model, the assessment of a prospective borrower.
If the P2P platform does not have a sacrosanct risk-scoring model, and cannot measure the risk levels of the borrower, the lender's investments can end up being high-risk."""

      "question": "Are there any regulations for P2P lending?",
      "ans":
          """The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has regulations for all Peer-to-Peer Lending platforms to protect the interest of lenders & borrowers. It made it mandatory for all the existing companies of P2P (Peer to Peer) to apply for Peer-to-Peer Lending License in case they want to continue working as a P2P platform.
RBI has set guidelines around how P2P lending platforms need to work. For example, any company that wants to offer P2P lending services needs to register for an NBFC-P2P license from the RBI.
RBI also ensures policies to reduce the risks in these platforms. As per RBI regulations, if a P2P platform shuts down, there is a pre-decided fallback business continuity plan that comes into effect in case of such events... The plan has all the details to keep the information of all lenders and borrowers safe, including all the nitty-gritty about servicing loans for the entire tenure in case of the closure of the platform. RBI has placed these regulatory measures in place to reduce the risks in P2P lending. 
According to the guidelines of the RBI, a lender cannot invest more than Rs. 10 lakhs across every Peer-to-Peer platform. Also, the RBI set a lending limit of up to Rs. 50,000/- which applies to the Borrower as well. RBI regulations for the functioning of the Peer-to-Peer Lending platform increase the credibility of such companies and have a role to play in the growing popularity of P2P in India."""

      "ans":
          "Invoice discounting involves three parties: the business selling its invoices (the seller), the financing company (the funder), and the customer who owes money to the business (the debtor). The seller submits unpaid invoices to the funder who pays a percentage upfront (around 80-90%). The funder collects the full amount from the debtor and deducts their fee before paying the remaining amount to the seller."

      "question": "What happens if the debtor does not pay the invoice?",

          "The main risk associated with invoice discounting is the risk of non-payment. If the debtor does not pay the invoice, the financing company may pursue legal action to recover the funds owed. However, the risk of non-payment is usually borne by the seller, who may be required to repurchase the invoice from the funder or provide additional collateral to secure the financing. "
