They are privately pooled investment vehicles generally set up by high-net-worth individuals, Indian or foreign, as per a defined investment policy. AIFs are distinctly different from traditional investment vehicles like mutual funds, or ETFs, and invest in non-traditional avenues such as venture capital, private equity, hedge funds, managed futures, etc, to make a profit, or benefit investors. AIFs provide an opportunity for investors to participate in alternative investments and diversify their portfolios, while also offering fund managers greater flexibility in their investment strategies."

          "Each AIF scheme should have a minimum corpus of Rs. 20 crores (Rs. 10 crores for angel funds). Along with that, there is also a cap on the number of investors each scheme can have. Most schemes cannot have more than 1000 investors, whereas angel funds can cater to a maximum of 200 investors."

For HNIs who are looking to diversify their portfolios and increase long-term returns on their investments while willing to take a considerable risk, AIFs seem like decent investment alternatives. But for those who can take low to high risk, mutual funds are the way to go. The decision between alternative investment funds and mutual funds should be based on your investment objectives, available capital, and long-term intentions.

          "In Portfolio Management System (PMS), each investor portfolio is different, and it’s a customized offering. PMS cannot pool money from different investors to create an investment fund. PMS investors can also choose to exit their investments anytime they want. On the other hand, AIFs pool money from investors and have a lock-in period ranging from 3 to 5 years."

      "ans":
          "An AIF accepts two individuals as joint partners for a minimum investment of one crore rupees. Joint investors may include an investor and their spouse, parent, or child. Only two persons can act as joint investors for an AIF, and for any other investors acting as joint investors, the minimum investment amount of INR 1 crore shall apply."

          "When an investor exits an AIF by a transfer of units or partnership interests to another investor (this transaction is called a ‘secondary transfer’), gains on the sale of units may be taxable directly in the hands of the investors. The taxability of gains on the sale of AIF units during a secondary transfer will depend on the holding period of the units. If the holding period is more than 36 months, the sale would be categorized as a long-term capital gain and taxed at 20% with indexation. If the holding period is less than 36 months, it would be considered a short-term capital gain and taxed at the applicable slab rates."
