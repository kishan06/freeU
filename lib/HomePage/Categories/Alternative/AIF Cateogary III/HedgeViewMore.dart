Hedge Funds are investments which collects capital from institutional and accredited investors, and invests them in domestic and international markets in order to generate high returns that are not corelated with market index returns. Naturally, hedge funds use risky investment strategies, and use a high minimum investment, charging a much higher rate compared to traditional investment funds.

For example, with futures, there is a right or an obligation to buy or sell an underlying stock at a pre-determined price, date and time. Options trading are the same but without an obligation.

Relative value arbitrage is used for buying and selling two very highly correlated securities simultaneously and book profits when the market are moving sideways. This is relative value arbitrage.
