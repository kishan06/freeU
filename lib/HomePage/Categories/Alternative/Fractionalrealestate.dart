      "question": "What do you mean by Fractional Ownership?",
      "ans":
          "Fractional ownership is a collective investment approach where investors pool their funds to buy an expensive asset and share passive ownership. Each investor receives returns and benefits based on their investment share, such as usage rights, priority access, income sharing, and reduced rates. This approach is popular for purchasing high-value assets like aircraft, vacation homes, and luxury cars. It allows investors to reduce their financial burden and form an investment strategy according to their risk appetite. Fractional ownership can also involve breaking up a real estate property into portions for investors to own.",
    },
    {
      "question": "Fractional Ownership of Real Estate Property ",
      "ans":
          "Fractional ownership breaks up an individual real estate property into portions and allows you to become the owner of a portion or more – based on the investment you make. You decide which asset you want to invest in and consequently, can form your investment strategy suited to your risk appetite. "
    },
    {
      "question": "Why invest in Commercial Real Estate (CRE)?",
      "ans":
          "Commercial Real Estate encompasses a wide range of properties including office buildings, industrial spaces, retail areas, schools, warehouses, hotels, and hostels. Fractional Ownership in Residential Properties typically generates lower returns due to lower rental yields, which can be as low as 2.5-3%, and the potential for tenants to vacate on short notice. In contrast, Commercial Real Estate offers more stability with rental yields of 8-10% and longer-term contracts, typically a minimum of three years, with professional tenants. CRE also offers potential for wealth creation through asset appreciation. As a result, Fractional Ownership in Commercial Real Estate is becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to traditional Real Estate Investments in India.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Is FRE investment compliant?",
      "ans":
          "Yes. Since the investment is routed through an SPV and investors are given a shareholding in the very same SPV, all investment records are filed under the ROC (Registrar of Companies) and need to be compliant with the Companies Act. The investment portal dealing with FRE needs to have a license from RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority) in order to carry out its operations."
    },

      "question": "Can NRIs invest in Commercial Real Estate?",
      "ans":
          "Yes. Any Indian citizen or an NRI (Non-Resident Indian) can own commercial real estate provided that a valid KYC (Know Your Customer), and documents are there, and regulatory guidelines are met. But NRIs can only make investments through their NRO (non-resident ordinary) accounts."

      "ans":
          "Exits happen in three ways—in the resale market is done through the investor's dashboard, private sales where investors are free to sell their fractional ownership to anyone on their own. The third way to exit fractional ownership is through complete asset sale, which requires agreement from the majority investors in the SPV."

      "ans":
          "REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust)  are similar to mutual funds in that they pool funds from investors and invest in profitable real estate assets such as government bonds, direct equity, and stocks, among others. However, investors cannot choose the property to invest in with REITs, whereas fractional ownership allows investors to select their desired property."
